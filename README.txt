Welcome to my MERN STACK DEMO-

working example @ https://mern-stack-demo.herokuapp.com/


**** Notes ***
! Redux-

reducer - store - actions 
reducer is switch statement
store has subscriptions
actions 

state is immutable single source of truth
only change can be made with action
reducers / changes are made with pure function

To keep things pure:
- operations with array
 use concat, slice, spread ratehr than push/splice

- operations with objects
  use object.assing() or spread operators

! Backend Structure-
Web Server to Proxy to API Server to PostGres Data Layer

! NoSQL vs SQL-

Table are now Collection
Record are now Document
Columns are now Fields

NoSQL has no Schema Requirements
CRUD update methods are all objects

! Mongoose - async connector

! Nodemon - restarts server everytime source code changes

API dev- Nodemon, Mongod, 

Create Model with Mongoose,
