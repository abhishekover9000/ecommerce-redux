Redux-

reducer - store - actions 
reducer is switch statement
store has subscriptions
actions 

state is immutable single source of truth
only change can be made with action
reducers / changes are made with pure function

To keep things pure:
- operations with array
 use concat, slice, spread ratehr than push/splice

- operations with objects
  use object.assing() or spread operators

Structure-

NoSQL vs SQL-

Table are now Collection
Record are now Document
Columns are now Fields

NoSQL has no Schema Requirements
